# 🏆 PROFESSIONAL MODE - BUG FIXED ✅

## 🔧 Problem Resolved

**Issue:** Professional Mode wasn't generating new blocks after dropping the first block.

**Root Cause:** The `blockDropped` state wasn't being reset correctly in Professional Mode, preventing new block generation.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Block Generation Logic
- **Added aggressive block generation** specifically for Professional Mode
- **Force reset `blockDropped` state** when crane has no block in Professional Mode
- **Improved state management** to prevent block generation deadlock

### 2. Key Code Changes

**GameEngine.java - Enhanced Update Logic:**
```java
// PROFESSIONAL MODE ENHANCED FIX: More aggressive block generation
if (currentDifficulty == DifficultyLevel.PROFESSIONAL) {
    if (crane.getCurrentBlock() == null) {
        blockDropped = false; // Force reset
        createNewBlock();
    }
    // Additional safety check for falling blocks
    else if (crane.getCurrentBlock() != null && crane.getCurrentBlock().isDropped()) {
        Block currentProfBlock = crane.getCurrentBlock();
        if (currentProfBlock.getY() > GAME_HEIGHT + 100) {
            handleBlockLost();
        }
    }
}
```

**GameEngine.java - Professional Mode Initialization:**
```java
if (difficulty == DifficultyLevel.PROFESSIONAL) {
    // PROFESSIONAL MODE BLOCK GENERATION FIX
    blockDropped = false; // Force reset to ensure first block gets created
    // ... other professional mode features
}
```

### 3. State Management Improvements
- **Force reset `blockDropped = false`** on Professional Mode activation
- **Enhanced state validation** during game state reset
- **Improved block placement completion** handling

## ✅ Verification Results
