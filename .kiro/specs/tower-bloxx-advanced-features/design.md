# Advanced Features Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for advanced features that will enhance the Tower Bloxx Java game. The design focuses on modular, extensible systems that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing rich, engaging gameplay experiences.

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Each feature system is self-contained and can be enabled/disabled independently
2. **Performance Optimization**: All effects and features are designed to maintain 60 FPS gameplay
3. **Extensibility**: Systems are designed to easily accommodate future enhancements
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All new features integrate without breaking existing functionality

### System Integration

The advanced features integrate with the existing GameEngine through a new `AdvancedFeaturesManager` that coordinates all enhanced systems:

```

├── AdvancedFeaturesManager
│   ├── VisualEffectsSystem
│   ├── SoundSystem
│   ├── PowerUpSystem
│   ├── WeatherSystem
│   ├── AchievementSystem
│   ├── CameraSystem
│   ├── MultiplayerManager
│   └── ThemeManager
```

## Components and Interfaces

    public void updateWeather(long gameTime);
    public void applyWeatherEffects(Block block);
    public void renderWeatherEffects(Graphics2D g2d);
}

public enum WeatherCondition {
    CLEAR, WINDY, RAINY, FOGGY, STORMY
}
```

### 5. Achievement System

**Architecture:**
- `AchievementManager`: Tracks progress and unlocks achievements
- `Achievement`: Data model for individual achievements
- `ChallengeSystem`: Daily and weekly challenges

**Key Classes:**
```java
public class AchievementManager {
    private Map<String, Achievement> achievements;
    private AchievementStorage storage;
    
    public void checkAchievements(GameEvent event);
    public void unlockAchievement(String achievementId);
    public List<Achievement> getUnlockedAchievements();
}

public class Achievement {
    private String id, name, description;
    private AchievementType type;
    private int targetValue, currentProgress;

- FPS monitoring with automatic quality adjustment
- Particle count limiting based on performance
- Effect complexity scaling for different hardware

### Error Recovery
- Fallback themes when custom themes fail to load
- Silent failure for non-critical sound effects
- Achievement system resilience to data corruption

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Individual system testing for each advanced feature
- Mock objects for GameEngine integration
- Performance benchmarking for particle systems

### Integration Testing
- Cross-system interaction testing
